# _Thermos_ | Flask Practice Project
This project follows the [PluralSight](https://www.pluralsight.com/) course, [_Introduction to the Flask Microframework_](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/flask-micro-framework-introduction/table-of-contents). The project will use [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to create a "bookmark sharing" web-app.

## Overview
This project is currently a work-in-progress. I will be updating files (and the README) continually as I make my way through the course.

Per the course instructor, I obtained a _Responsive_ template from [Initializr](http://www.initializr.com/). (To replicate this template, go to the  _Initializer_ website and select "_Responsive_". Under "_H5BP Optional_", select only "_404 Page_".) All HTML files from _Initializer_ are located in the `templates` directory. Other files, including CSS and JavaScript files, are located in the `static` directory.

The `thermos` directory contains `__init__.py`, also per the instructor. Up to this point, the file has remained empty.

The `thermos` directory also contains `thermos.py`, which contains the _Flask_ project.

## Dependencies
For this project, I am using [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). I have also created a virtual environment in which to run this project, using the `venv` module for Python 3.

To replicate these things, first install Python 3 (you can find instructions on Python's [website](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)). You should also ensure that you can [install packages](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#requirements-for-installing-packages) with _pip_.

I am using a Windows device to create a virtual environment.
